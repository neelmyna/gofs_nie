DAY1 NOTES:

To copy the trainer repo:

To update the trainer repo:
$ git pull origin main

Config commands:
$ git config --global user.name "user_name"
$ git config --global user.email "user_email"

To copy my repo for read and write operations:
Template:

$ git clone https://PAT@github.com/user_name/repo_name

3 commands to update our Repo:
1. $ git add .
From the current, mark all the files that need to be updated (Keepting the folder structure intact)
Here the git creates a list of files to be updated)

2. $ git commit -m "Relevant message"

This creates the object that need to be sent to the remote repo (that need to be updated in the remote repo)

3. $ git push origin main

push is to update the remote repo from the local. The object is sent to the server when this command is run.

main is the default branch which is created with every git repo.

NOTE: When ever we run the PUSH command, the PULL is implicitly run 1st. And only then the PUSH is run.
